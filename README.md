- 👋 Hi, I’m @Michael-McD
- 👀 I’m interested in advanced driving, cognitive sciences (predictive coding in particular), politicial ecconmics and the like.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about back propagation as a neural network training stratedgy.  The calculus for the gradient decent is the thing here!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building a self evidencing neural network (a la Mark Solms as described in "The Hidden Spring").
- 📫 How to reach me via email: michael.mcd.mtm@gmail.com


***About me***  

I read a lot as I'm now retired, and travel between South Africa, England and Japan. I'm a Europhile, but am losing my faith in the liberal democratic project (certiantly as a template for the rest of the world).
